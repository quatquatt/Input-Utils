Short-term features (hopefully next update):
    - Fix the bullshit with unchecked / unsafe exceptions
    - Readd comments and proper documentation
Medium-term features:
    - Extract repetitive while-loop logic into a generic method since it seems to all be the same
    - Improve unit testing to check for correct output with an empty string, as well as how errors are handled
Long-term goals:
    - Make the code more easily extendable
    - Reintroduce custom prompts (in a way that's more maintainable than last time)
    - Improve error handling (possibly by writing The Error Handler class)
